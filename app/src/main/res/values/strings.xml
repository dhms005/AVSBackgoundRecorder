    <string name="str_q1">Q: Is it safe?</string>
    <string name="str_a1">A: Yes, it is safe and secure. We do not collect personal information from user. All data generated by this app will be saved on your device. We never use, transfer or back up user data.</string>
    <string name="str_q2">Q: Is there any way to recover the deleted files?</string>
    <string name="str_a2">A: No, deleted video cannot be recovered. Since we do not back up your data, we could not do this. The recorded videos are saved on your internal or external SD card.</string>
    <string name="str_q3">Q: Why is the notification icon displayed during video recording? Is there a way to remove it?</string>
    <string name="str_a3">A: If we do not display notifications, Android will not allow video recording in the background. But you can change the application name, icon notification icon on the settings screen.</string>
    <string name="str_q4">Q: Why does recording stop when a video file size reached 3GB (about 30 minutes)?</string>
    <string name="str_a4">A: The default, Android system will stop a recording when a file size reached 3GB or duration is 30 minutes. Or if you are saving file on SD Card you should format SD Card is exFAT instead of FAT so the app can record video long time (more 30 minutes).</string>
    <string name="str_q5">Q: Why the volume key does not work when the device is locked for a while?</string>
    <string name="str_a5">A: This is because Android disables the volume buttons when the device is locked for a long time. You can use the power button for this situation. In addition, you can shake your device and make video recording. You must enable these features on the Settings screen.</string>
    <string name="str_q6">Q: Why doesn\'t the volume key work when you are talking on the phone or listening to music?</string>
    <string name="str_a6">A: Since hardware volume buttons are shared resources, only one application can use them simultaneously. While you are talking on the phone, the phone application gets the right to the buttons. All other applications can not use it at the moment.</string>
